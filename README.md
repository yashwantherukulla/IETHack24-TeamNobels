# IETHack24-TeamNobels

Welcome to the **IETHack24-TeamNobels** repository! This project is a comprehensive suite of tools and services designed to streamline the development and deployment of Go-based backend applications. The project is divided into three main components:

1. **go-sail**: A powerful CLI tool for generating Go backend project templates with built-in logging and caching features.
2. **go-sail-ML**: A machine learning-based code analysis tool that evaluates code quality, security, and provides detailed descriptions.
3. **go-sail-backend**: A backend service that handles user authentication, API key management, and plan upgrades.

## Usage

### go-sail
Once installed, you can start using `go-sail` to generate templates for your Go projects.

1. **Initialize a new Go project**:
   ```bash
   go-sail create my-app
   ```

### go-sail-ML
To analyze code quality and security:

1. **Run the ML analysis**:
   ```bash
   python src/eval/code_analyser.py
   ```

### go-sail-backend
To start the backend service:

1. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## Commands

### go-sail
- **Create a new project**:
  ```bash
  go-sail create my-app
  ```
- **Evaluate a project**:
  ```bash
  go-sail evaluate --file path/to/file
  ```

### go-sail-ML
- **Analyze a repository**:
  ```bash
  python src/eval/code_analyser.py
  ```

### go-sail-backend

### Commit Message Guidelines
We follow the Conventional Commits specification for our commit messages. Here are some of the most common types of commits:

- `feat`: A new feature for the user or a significant addition to the codebase.
- `fix`: A bug fix.
- `chore`: Regular maintenance tasks, updates to build processes, or other changes that don't modify src or test files.
- `docs`: Documentation only changes.
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
